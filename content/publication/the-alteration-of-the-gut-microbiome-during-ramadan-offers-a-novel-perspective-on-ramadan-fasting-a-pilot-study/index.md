abstract: An intermittent fasting regimen is widely perceived to lead to various
  beneficial health effects, including weight loss, the alleviation of insulin
  resistance, and the restructuring of a healthy gut microbiome. Because it
  shares certain commonalities with this dietary intervention, Ramadan fasting
  is sometimes misinterpreted as intermittent fasting, even though there are
  clear distinctions between these two regimens. The main purpose of this study
  is to verify whether Ramadan fasting drives the same beneficial effects as
  intermittent fasting by monitoring alterations in the gut microbiota. We
  conducted a study involving 20 Muslim individuals who were practicing Ramadan
  rituals and assessed the composition of their gut microbiomes during the
  4-week period of Ramadan and the subsequent 8-week period post-Ramadan. Fecal
  microbiome analysis was conducted, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were
  assessed using liquid-chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry. The observed decrease
  in the levels of SCFAs and beneficial bacteria during Ramadan, along with the
  increased microbial diversity post-Ramadan, suggests that the daily diet
  during Ramadan may not provide adequate nutrients to maintain robust gut
  microbiota. Additionally, the notable disparities in the functional genes
  detected through the metagenomic analysis and the strong correlation between
  Lactobacillus and SCFAs provide further support for our hypothesis.
