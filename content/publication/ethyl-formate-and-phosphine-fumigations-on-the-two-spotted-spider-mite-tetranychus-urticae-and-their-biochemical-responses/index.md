abstract: Two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, is a polyphagous pest to
  a variety of plants and they are hard to be controlled due to occurrence of
  resistance to acaricides. In this study, biochemical evaluation after ethyl
  formate (EF) and phosphine (PH3) fumigation towards T. urticae might help
  officials to control them in quarantine purposes. PH3 fumigation controlled
  eggs (LC50; 0.158 mg/L), nymphs (LC50; 0.030 mg/L), and adults (LC50; 0.059
  mg/L) of T. urticae, and EF effectively affected nymphs (LC50; 2.826 mg/L)
  rather than eggs (LC50; 6.797 mg/L) and adults (LC50; 5.836 mg/L). In a longer
  exposure time of 20 h, PH3 fumigation was 94.2-fold more effective tool for
  control of T. urticae than EF fumigant. EF and PH3 inhibited cytochrome c
  oxidase (COX) activity differently in both nymphs and adults of T. urticae. It
  confirmed COX is one of target sites of these fumigants in T. urticae and COX
  is involved in the respiratory chain as complex IV. Molecular approaches
  showed that EF fumigation completely down-regulated the expression of cox11
  gene at the concentration of LC10 value, while PH3 up-regulated several genes
  greater than twofold in T. urticae nymphs treated with the concentration of
  LC50 value. These increased genes by PH3 fumigation are ndufv1, atpB, para,
  and ace, responsible for the expression of NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone]
  flavoprotein 1, ATP synthase, and acetylcholinesterase in insects,
  respectively. Lipidomic analyses exhibited a significant difference between
  two fumigants-exposed groups and the control, especially an ion with 815.46
  m/z was analyzed less than twofold in the fumigants-treated group. It was
  identified as PI(15:1/18:3) and it may be used as a biomarker to EF and PH3
  toxicity. These findings may contribute to set an effective control strategy
  on T. urticae by methyl bromide alternatives such as EF and PH3 because they
  have shared target sites on the respiratory chain in the pest.
