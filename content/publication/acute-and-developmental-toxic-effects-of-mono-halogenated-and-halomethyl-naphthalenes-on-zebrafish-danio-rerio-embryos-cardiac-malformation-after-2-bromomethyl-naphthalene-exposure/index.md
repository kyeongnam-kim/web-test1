abstract: Polyhalogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAHs) represent a
  major environmental concern due to their persistency and toxicity. Among them,
  mono-halogenated (HNs) and halomethyl naphthalenes (HMNs) are not
  well-studied, and the toxicity of many HNs to fishes has not been reported. In
  this study, we exposed zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) embryos to naphthalene and
  five HNs at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 mg L−1 to assess acute
  toxicities and developmental effects. Among them, 2-bromomethyl naphthalene
  (2-BMN) produced moderate lethal effects (96-h LC50 = 1.4 mg L−1) and
  significantly reduced hatchability. Abnormal phenotypes, including pericardial
  edema, spine curvature, and shortened body length, were also induced by 2-BMN
  (96-h EC50 = 0.45 mg L−1). Treatments of 0.5–2.0 mg L−1 2-BMN evoked cardiac
  malformations via significant down-regulation of the cacna1c gene, which codes
  the voltage-dependent calcium channel, at 72 hpf and up-regulation of the nppa
  gene, responsible for the expression of natriuretic peptides, at 96 hpf in
  zebrafish. One presumable toxic photo-dissociated metabolite of 2-BMN, the
  2-naphthylmethyl radical, may be responsible for the toxic effect on zebrafish
  embryos. HPAHs must be monitored and managed due to their adverse effects on
  living organisms at low concentrations.

  *Highlights*

  • 2-Bromomethyl naphthalene (2-BMN) showed potent lethal effects to zebrafish embryos.

  • 2-BMN caused malformations in zebrafish embryos such as pericardial edemas.

  • 2-BMN induced abnormal heart formation in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) with lower heart beat rate.

  • An arrythmia-related nppa gene during development was upregulated by 2-BMN treatment.
