abstract: In this study, fluorene (FL), FL-1-carboxylic acid (FC-1), and
  FL-9-carboxylic acid (FC-9) were investigated to understand their acute
  toxicity by measuring inhibitory effects on hatching rates and developmental
  processes of zebrafish embryos (*Danio rerio*). For exposure concentrations up
  to 3000 μg/L, FC-1 alone showed acute toxicity at 1458 μg/L for LC50 value.
  FC-1 caused yolk sac and spinal deformities, and pericardial edema. Molecular
  studies were undertaken to understand FC-1 toxicity examining 61 genes after
  exposure to 5 μM (equivalent to LC20 value of FC-1) in embryos. In the
  FC-1-treated embryos, the expression of the cyp7a1 gene, involved in bile acid
  biosynthesis, was dramatically decreased, while the expression of the Il-1β
  gene involved in inflammation was remarkably increased. In addition to these
  findings, in FC-1-treated embryos, the expression of nppa gene related to the
  differentiation of the myocardium was 3-fold increased. On the other hand,
  cyp1a, cyp3a, ugt1a1, abcc4, mdr1, and sult1st1 responsible for detoxification
  of xenobiotics were upregulated in FC-9-treated embryos. Taken together,
  carboxylation on carbon 1 of FL increased acute toxicity in zebrafish embryos,
  and its toxicity might be related to morphological changes with modification
  of normal biological functions and lowered defense ability.

  Highlights

  •

  Fluorene-1-carboxylic acid exhibited potent acute toxicities on zebrafish embryos, including high mortality rate.


  •

  Fluorene-1-carboxylic acid induced abnormal developments such as yolk sac, spinal deformities, and pericardial edema.


  •

  Fluorene-1-carboxylic acid down-regulated cyp7a1 gene expression involved in bile acid biosynthesis.


  •

  Carboxylation on 1-carbon in fluorine ring core might mediate metabolic modifications when compared to fluorine.
