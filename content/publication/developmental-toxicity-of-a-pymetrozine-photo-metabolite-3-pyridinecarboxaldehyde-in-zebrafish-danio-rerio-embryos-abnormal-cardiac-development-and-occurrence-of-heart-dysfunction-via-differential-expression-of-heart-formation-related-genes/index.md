abstract: Pymetrozine (PYM) is worldwide used to control sucking insect pests in
  rice-cultivated fields and it is degraded into various metabolites including
  3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (3-PCA). These two pyridine compounds were used to
  determine their impacts on aquatic environments, particularly on the aquatic
  animal model zebrafish (Danio rerio). PYM did not show acute toxicities in
  terms of lethality, hatching rate, and phenotypic changes in zebrafish embryos
  in the tested ranges up to a concentration of 20 mg/L. 3-PCA exhibited acute
  toxicity with LC50 and EC50 values of 10.7 and 2.07 mg/L, respectively. 3-PCA
  treatment caused phenotypic changes including pericardial edema, yolk sac
  edema, hyperemia, and curved spine, at a concentration of 10 mg/L after 48 h
  of exposure. Abnormal cardiac development was observed in 3-PCA-treated
  zebrafish embryos at a concentration of 5 mg/L with reduced heart function. In
  a molecular analysis, cacna1c, encoding a voltage-dependent calcium channel,
  was significantly down-regulated in the 3-PCA-treated embryos, indicating
  synaptic and behavioral defects. Hyperemia and incomplete intersegmental
  vessels were observed in 3-PCA-treated embryos. Based on these results, it is
  necessary to generate scientific information on the acute and chronic toxicity
  of PYM and its metabolites with regular monitoring of their residues in
  aquatic environments.

  Highlights

  • A primary metabolite of pymetrozine, 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (3-PCA), is more toxic than pymetrozine to zebrafish embryos.


  • 3-PCA causes morphological changes as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema.


  • 3-PCA treatment refers abnormal cardiac formation and reduces heart beat rates.


  • A heart development-related gene tnnt2a was significantly suppressed in the 3-PCA-treated embryos.


  • 3-PCA induced hyperemia with shortened whole body length and some vasotoxic defects.
