abstract: Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs), which are a form of
  microbial dysbiosis in freshwater environments, are an emerging environmental
  and public health concern. Additionally, the freshwater environment serves as
  a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which pose a risk of
  transmission during microbial dysbiosis, such as cyanoHABs. However, the
  interactions between potential synergistic pollutants, cyanoHABs, and ARGs
  remain poorly understood. During cyanoHABs, Microcystis and high microcystin
  levels were dominant in all the nine regions of the river sampled. The
  resistome, mobilome, and microbiome were interrelated and linked to the
  physicochemical properties of freshwater. Planktothrix and Pseudanabaena
  competed with Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria during cyanoHABs. Forty two
  ARG carriers were identified, most of which belonged to Actinobacteriota and
  Proteobacteria. ARG carriers showed a strong correlation with ARGs density,
  which decreased with the severity of cyanoHAB. Although ARGs decreased due to
  a reduction of ARG carriers during cyanoHABs, mobile gene elements (MGEs) and
  virulence factors (VFs) genes increased. We explored the relationship between
  cyanoHABs and ARGs for potential synergistic interaction. Our findings
  demonstrated that cyanobacteria compete with freshwater commensal bacteria
  such as Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria, which carry ARGs in freshwater,
  resulting in a reduction of ARGs levels. Moreover, cyanoHABs generate biotic
  and abiotic stress in the freshwater microbiome, which may lead to an increase
  in MGEs and VFs. Exploration of the intricate interplays between microbiome,
  resistome, mobilome, and pathobiome during cyanoHABs not only revealed that
  the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of microbial dysbiosis but also
  emphasizes the need to prioritize the prevention of microbial dysbiosis in the
  risk management of ARGs.
