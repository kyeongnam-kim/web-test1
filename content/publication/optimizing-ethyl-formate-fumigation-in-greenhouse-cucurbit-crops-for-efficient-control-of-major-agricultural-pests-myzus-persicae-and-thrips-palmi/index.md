  Background

  Ethyl formate (EF) is naturally occurring volatile compound used as quarantine fumigant for pest control. Recently, conversion of uses of EF was tried from quarantine to agricultural field due to its promising efficacy. However, there is a lack of studies on the residue pattern on crops and soil and the phytotoxic mechanism

  of EF in greenhouse environment. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, residue analysis, and phytotoxicity of EF fumigation in controlling Myzus persicae and Thrips palmi, on cucurbit crops and establish an optimized fumigation strategy for use in greenhouses.


  Results

  The results showed that EF was more effective against M. persicae than against T. palmi. Residue analysis indicated that EF rapidly decomposed and was not retained after 30 min in leaves and 2 h in soil after fumigation, suggesting the potential for residue-free pest control. Phytotoxicity test revealed that watermelon was the most sensitive crop to EF, and H2O2 accumulation was observed above a concentration of 7.5 g/m3. A strategy to reduce phytotoxicity with sodium bicarbonate during fumigation showed promising results in reducing phytotoxic effects on the crops. The optimized EF fumigation with 6 g/m3 was applied in a greenhouse, resulting in 100% and 40% mortality of M. persicae and T. palmi, respectively, with no notable phytotoxicity and EF residue in the treated crops and soil.


  Conclusion

  This study demonstrates that optimized EF fumigation can be an environmentally sustainable method for controlling pests in greenhouses, paving the way for improved pest management practices and sustainable agriculture. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the potential of EF fumigation for other crops and pests.
