abstract: Combined toxicity can occur in the environment according to the
  combination of single substances, and the combination works additively or in a
  synergistic or antagonistic mode. In our study, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol
  (TCP) and 2-(bromomethyl)naphthalene (2-BMN) were used to measure combined
  toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. As the lethal concentration (LC)
  values were obtained through single toxicity, the lethal effects at all
  combinational concentrations were considered synergistic by the Independent
  Action model. At 96 hpf, the combined toxicity of TCP LC10 + 2-BMN LC10, the
  lowest combinational concentration, resulted in high mortality, strong
  inhibition of hatching, and various morphological changes in zebrafish
  embryos. Combined treatment resulted in the downregulation of cyp1a, leading
  to reduced detoxification of the treated chemicals in embryos. These
  combinations may enhance endocrine-disrupting properties via upregulation of
  vtg1 in embryos, and inflammatory responses and endoplasmic reticulum stress
  were found to upregulate il-β, atf4, and atf6. These combinations might induce
  severe abnormal cardiac development in embryos via downregulation of myl7,
  cacna1c, edn1, and vmhc expression, and upregulation of the nppa gene.
  Therefore, the combined toxicity of these two chemicals was observed in
  zebrafish embryos, which proves that similar substances can exhibit stronger
  combined toxicity than single toxicity.

  *Highlights*

  • 3,5,6-Trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) shows high lethal effects to zebrafish embryos.

  • 2-(Bromomethyl)naphthalene (2-BMN) exhibits weaker lethal effects than TCP.

  • Combined treatment of TCP + 2-BMN occurs severe cardiac developmental toxicity.

  • Abnormal heart development is related on the down-regulation of myl7 gene.
