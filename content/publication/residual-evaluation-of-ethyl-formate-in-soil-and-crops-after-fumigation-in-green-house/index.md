abstract: Ethyl formate (EF) is a potent fumigant replacing methyl bromide. The
  use of EF is limited to a quarantine process. Appling EF to agricultural field
  as a safe insecticide in greenhouse give us valuable benefits including less
  residual concern. In this regard, residual pattern after EF fumigation in
  greenhouse should be undertaken. In the previous study, we have established
  agricultural control concentration of EF to control pests in a greenhouse. EF
  was fumigated at 5 g m-3 level for 2 h. The concentration of EF inside a
  greenhouse was analyzed to be 4.1-4.3 g m-3 at 30 min after fumigation. To
  prepare an analytical method for residues in cucumber crops and soil in the
  greenhouse, the limit of detection (LOD) of the method was 100 ng g-1 and the
  limit of quantitation (LOQ) of this method was 300 ng g-1. R2 values of
  calibration curves for crops and soil were 0.991-0.997. In samples collected
  immediately after ventilation, EF concentration was determined to be below LOQ
  level. In addition, EF level was below LOQ in samples collected at 3 h after
  ventilation except that leaf samples of melon during the flowering period
  showed a level of 1,068.9 ng g-1. Taken together, these results indicate that
  EF used in quarantine can be applied to agricultural fields without residual
  issue as an effective fumigant for insect pest control.
