abstract: Individual and combined toxicities of endosulfan (ENDO) with
  phenanthrene (PHE) were evaluated using zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults. The
  96-h LC50 values for ENDO and PHE were 4.6 μg L−1 and 920 μg L−1,
  respectively. To evaluate the mixture toxicity, LC10 and LC50 concentrations
  were grouped into four combinations as ENDO-LC10 + PHE-LC10, ENDO-LC10 +
  PHE-LC50, ENDO-LC50 + PHE-LC10, and ENDO-LC50 + PHE-LC50, and their acute
  toxicities were determined. The combination of LC50-ENDO and LC10-PHE
  exhibited a synergistic effect. In addition, acetylcholinesterase activity
  decreased in zebrafish bodies exposed to ENDO with or without PHE. Combined
  treatments induced higher glutathione S-transferase activity compared to
  individual treatments. Carboxylesterase activity increased in both heads and
  bodies of ENDO-treated fishes compared with PHE-treated fishes. Using RT-qPCR
  technique, CYP1A gene expression significantly up-regulated in all
  combinations, whereas CYP3A was unchanged, suggesting that enzymes involved in
  defense may play different roles in the detoxification. CYP7A1 gene
  responsible for bile acid biosynthesis is dramatically down-regulated after
  exposure to the synergistic combination exposure, referring that the
  synergistic effect may be resulted from the reduction of bile production in
  zebrafishes. Among gender-related genes, CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 genes in female
  zebrafish decreased after treatment with ENDO alone and combination of
  LC50-ENDO and LC10-PHE. This might be related to a reduction in cortisol
  production. The overall results indicated that ENDO and PHE were toxic to
  zebrafish adults both individually and in combination, and that their
  co-presence induced changes in the expression of genes responsible for
  metabolic processes and defense mechanisms.
