abstract: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is produced in nature and is known to be a
  source of carbon and sulfur for marine microorganisms. It is currently used in
  many biological experiments, pharmaceutical preparations, and energy-producing
  systems such as lithium batteries. Therefore, the toxicity of DMSO has been
  studied because of its various implications to living organisms; however, such
  studies are largely limited to measuring individual toxicity whereas the
  combined toxicity of DMSO with other compounds has rarely been investigated.
  In the present study, the combined acute toxicity of 0.1% and 0.5% DMSO with
  vanadium was investigated in zebrafish embryos; the LC50 values of these
  combinations were 62.0 and 6.38 ppm, respectively. In individual toxicity
  tests, neither DMSO nor vanadium caused such mortality levels. Therefore, both
  0.1% and 0.5% DMSO had a synergistic effect with vanadium, and this result was
  confirmed using an independent action model. This combined toxicity delayed
  the development of zebrafish embryos and caused pericardial edema. The
  synergistic effect of DMSO and vanadium was found to be related to reduced pH
  and inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity. Given its potential
  synergistic toxicity to aquatic organisms, the introduction of DMSO into the
  environment should be investigated and routinely monitored.

  *Highlights*

  • DMSO did not show acute toxicity on zebrafish embryos at the concentrations of 0.1%.


  • Vanadium ions did not exhibit acute toxicity on zebrafish embryos at the concentration of 50 ppm.


  • Synergistic acte toxicity was found in the simultaneous treatment of DMSO and vanadium.


  • Developmental malformation in zebrafish embryos were observed with the synergistic effects.
