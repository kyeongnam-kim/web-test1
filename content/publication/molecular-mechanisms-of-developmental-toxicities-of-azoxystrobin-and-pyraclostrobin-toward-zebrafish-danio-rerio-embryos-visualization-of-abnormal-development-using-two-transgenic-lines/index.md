abstract: Azoxystrobin (AZ) and pyraclostrobin (PY) are strobilurin fungicides
  that inhibit fungal mitochondrial respiration. In this study, a representative
  model, zebrafish (Danio rerio), was used as a test species for acute and
  developmental toxicity. Survival and malformation rates were observed only
  PY-treated embryos, with an LC50 value of 77.75 ppb accompanied by a dramatic
  decrease in hatching rate, while AZ did not show great mortality.
  Morphological changes were observed in PY-treated embryos with the occurrence
  of pericadial edema at 25 ppb. A delay in growth was observed after treatment
  with pyraclostrobin at 50 ppb. Use of genetically engineered Tg(cmlc:EGFP)
  allowed fluorescence observation during heart development. PY interfered with
  normal heart development via upregulation of the nppa gene responsible for the
  expression of natriuretic peptides. Heart function was dramatically reduced as
  indicated by reduced heart rates. Increased expression of the nppa gene was
  also seen in AZ-treated embryos. The expression level of cyp24a1 was also
  up-regulated, while ugt1a1 and sult1st6 were down-regulated after treatment of
  zebrafish embryos with AZ or PY. Overall, strobilurin fungicides might inhibit
  normal heart formation and function within the range of concentrations tested.

  Highlights
  •
  Pyraclostrobin (PY) exhibited strong acute toxicity to zebrafish embryos.

  •
  PY generated pericardial and yolk sac edemas in zebrafish embryos.

  •
  PY inhibited body growth in a transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli1a:EGFP).

  •
  PY interfered heart formation in a transgenic zebrafish Tg(cmlc:EGFP).

  •
  Heart malformation by PY is strongly related to up-regulation of nppa gene.
