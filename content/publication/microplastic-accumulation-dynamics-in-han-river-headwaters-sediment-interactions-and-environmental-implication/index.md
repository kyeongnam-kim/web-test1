abstract: The prevalence of microplastic (MP) contamination has become a
  significant environmental concern due to its pervasive nature and persistent
  effects. While sediments are considered major repositories for MPs,
  information on their spatial distribution within these matrices is
  insufficient. This research examined both the horizontal and vertical presence
  of MPs in the sediments surrounding Lake Paldang in South Korea, alongside a
  comprehensive evaluation of the physicochemical characteristics of the samples
  obtained. The total content of MPs varied from 2.15 to 122.2 particles g−1.
  The average contents of MPs on surface sediments were 40.47, 34.14, 5.01, and
  8.19 particles g−1 in north mainstream (NM), south mainstream (SM), tributary
  (TB), and Tributary catchment (TC) based on Sonae Island, Gyeongan stream,
  respectively. The most abundant MP types were polyethylene (PE),
  polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polypropylene (PP), accounting for more
  than 70% of the total MPs. The most abundant sizes of MPs were within 45–100
  µm. At all sediment depths, polymers were distributed in the order PE, PP, and
  polyester in NM, SM, and TC, respectively, whereas PTFE mainly occurred in the
  surface layer. MPs distribution also exhibited seasonal variation as larger
  inflows and flow rates varied with season.

  *Highlights*

  • Microplastics in Lake Paldang sediments were analyzed by FT-IR with microscope.


  • The most abundant MPs were PE, PTFE, and PP with the size ranges of 45-100 µm.


  • MPs such as PP, PE and polyester were found in all sediment depths.


  • Only PTFE was primarily found in the surface layer of sediment.


  • Distribution of MPs was according to seasonal variations with larger inflows.
