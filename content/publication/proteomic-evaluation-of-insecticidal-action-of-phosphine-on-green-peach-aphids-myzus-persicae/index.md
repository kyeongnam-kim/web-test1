abstract: Methyl bromide (MB) has been used in a wide range of applications, but
  since it was determined to be an ozone-depleting compound, it has only been
  used for pre-shipment and quarantine purposes in trade. Phosphine (PH3) is
  currently the ideal fumigant as an MB alternative worldwide. However, the
  development of PH3 resistance in the target insect pest and longer PH3
  fumigation treatment times raise questions about the continued use of PH3.
  This study attempted to shorten treatment time via combination treatment with
  ethyl formate (EF). Planococcus citri was used as the main quarantine pest in
  Korea, and the acute toxicity of EF, PH3, and EF + PH3 was determined at every
  developmental stage. EF treatment at 4 h showed LCT99 values of 45.85~65.43
  mg∙h/L, and PH3 treatment at 20 h showed that of 0.13~0.83 mg∙h/L depending on
  the developmental stage. The efficacy of PH3 decreased after reducing the
  treatment time, but synergistic effects were observed at all stages of
  development of P. citri when both fumigants were used simultaneously for 4 h.
  After combined treatment, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase expression and the
  production of two phospholipids, PI(O-16:0) and PC(18:2), were significantly
  reduced in treated P. citri adults compared with the control. Therefore,
  combined treatments might be key to reducing the treatment time and resistance
  of PH3 in the field.
