abstract: With an increase in the international trade of agricultural and
  non-agricultural products, there is an increase in the possibility of
  introducing hitchhiking insect pests such as Halyomorpha halys, which has been
  detected on imported vehicles and agricultural machinery. Although methyl
  bromide (MB) is provisionally used to control invasive pests, it is classified
  as a restricted chemical owing to its potential to deplete the ozone layer and
  pose health risks to humans in cases of inadequate ventilation, as well as
  concerns regarding consumer safety. Therefore, this study investigated ethyl
  formate’s (EF’s) efficacy against H. halys and its efficacy and sorption, as
  an alternative to MB, on main electronic components, including alternators,
  ignition coils, and motors. Fumigation with 35 and 70 g/m3 EF for 4 h at 15 °C
  had no damage on the main electronic components as evaluated using various
  operation tests. In a commercial trial, H. halys infestation was effectively
  controlled with 35 g/m3 EF fumigated for 4 h at 23 °C using a 30 m3 polyvinyl
  chloride tarpaulin fumigation chamber. After ventilation, the EF concentration
  decreased below the safety level within 10 min and reached the zero level
  within 40 min for worker safety. This novel sanitary treatment using EF
  fumigation on imported agricultural machinery could be an effective method
  without causing mechanical damage.
