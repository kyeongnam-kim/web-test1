abstract: α-Endosulfan and some polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) are
  persistent in the environment and can reach crop products via contaminated
  agricultural soils. They may even be present as mixtures in the soil and
  induce mixture toxicity in soil organisms such as earthworms. In this study,
  the combined toxicities of PAHs with α-endosulfan were determined in Eisenia
  fetida adults using an artificial soil system. α-Endosulfan and five PAHs were
  tested for their acute toxicity toward E. fetida in artificial soils. Only
  α-endosulfan, fluorene, and phenanthrene showed acute toxicities, with LC50
  values of 9.7, 133.2, and 86.2 mg kg−1, respectively. A mixture toxicity assay
  was conducted using α-endosulfan at LC10 and fluorene or phenanthrene at LC50
  in the artificial soils. Upon exposure to the mixture of fluorene and
  α-endosulfan, earthworms were killed in increasing numbers owing to their
  synergistic effects, while no other mixture showed any additional toxicity
  toward the earthworms. Along with the acute toxicity results, the biochemical
  and molecular changes in the fluorene- and phenanthrene-treated earthworms
  with or without α-endosulfan treatment demonstrated that enhancement of
  glutathione S-transferase activity was dependent on the addition of PAH
  chemicals, and the *HSP70* gene expression increased with the addition of
  α-endosulfan. Taken together, these findings contribute toward understanding
  the adverse effects of pollutants when present separately or in combination
  with other types of chemicals.
