abstract: Regulation of melanin production via the MC1R signaling pathway is a
  protective mechanism of the skin of living organisms against exposure to
  ultraviolet rays. The discovery of human skin-whitening agents has been one of
  the most intense pursuits of the cosmetic industry. The MC1R signaling pathway
  is activated by its agonist, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), and
  mainly regulates melanogenesis. Here, we evaluated the antimelanogenic
  activities of curcumin (CUR) and its two derivatives, dimethoxycurcumin (DMC)
  and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and zebrafish
  embryos. CUR and BDMC reduced the α-MSH-induced melanin production in B16F10
  cells and also downregulated the expression of the melanin-production-related
  genes Tyr, Mitf, Trp-1, and Trp-2. Moreover, the biological activity of these
  two compounds against melanogenesis was confirmed in in vivo experiments using
  zebrafish embryos. However, the highest concentration of CUR (5 µM) resulted
  in slight malformations in zebrafish embryos, as indicated by acute toxicity
  tests. In contrast, DMC did not show any biological activity in vitro or in
  vivo. Conclusively, BDMC is a strong candidate as a skin-whitening agent.
