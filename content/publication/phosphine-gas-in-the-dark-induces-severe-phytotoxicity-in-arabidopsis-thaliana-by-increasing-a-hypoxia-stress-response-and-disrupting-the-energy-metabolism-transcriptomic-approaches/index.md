abstract: The increase in worldwide trade has caused the quality maintenance of
  commercialized agriproducts to be crucial in keeping its economic value. In
  recent years, methyl bromide (MB) has been used dominantly during quarantine
  and pre-shipment, despite it being an environmental hazard with global
  repercussions. Through this study, it was shown that Arabidopsis thalianaâ€™s 2
  h exposure to the MB treatment displayed no signs of phytotoxicity, whereas
  its 4 h exposure significantly interfered with growth. The transcriptomic
  analysis found the molecular modifications in A. thaliana after the MB
  fumigation with the up-regulation of genes specifically relative to the
  abiotic and oxidative stress, and the down-regulation of auxin transporter
  genes. Some important gene expressions were verified by RT-qPCR and their
  expression patterns were similar. Oxidative stresses via the reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in relation to MB phytotoxicity were confirmed with the
  increased malondialdehyde in MB-4h-treated A. thaliana. Uneven distribution of
  auxins via lower expression of auxin transporter genes was also determined
  using UPLC-ESI-QqQ MS. Application of two ROS scavengers such as
  N-acetyl-cysteine and L-glutathione minimized MB phytotoxic effect in A.
  thaliana. Therefore, MB caused severe oxidative stress, and alternatives
  regarding the use of MB should be considered.
