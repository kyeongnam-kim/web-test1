abstract: To monitor and evaluate the risk of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
  contamination in Pohang, Korea, the concentration and distribution of 29 PCBs
  in paddy soils were determined using high-resolution gas
  chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. The overall concentrations
  of Σ29 PCBs in the paddy soils of the areas close to the heavily industrial
  city of Pohang (268–1833 pg g−1 dw) were higher than those in the paddies from
  Anseong (106.6–222.6 pg g−1 dw) in Korea. In Pohang, the major contributors to
  the Σ29 PCBs were the non-dioxin-like PCBs, including the PCBs 28, 52, 70,
  101, 118, 138, 153, and 180, which correspond to 48–62% of the total PCBs. The
  toxic equivalency (TEQ) values obtained from the 12 dioxin-like PCBs from
  Pohang (0.03–1.03 pg TEQ g−1 dw) showed that PCB 126 contributed the highest
  toxicity, possibly posing a risk to the living organisms. The results of both
  principal component and cluster analysis based on the PCB homologue patterns
  demonstrated that each sampling site showed a similar PCBs contamination
  pattern, and Aroclor 1254, which is likely used by small and big steel
  factories, was identified as a major source of PCB contamination in Pohang.
