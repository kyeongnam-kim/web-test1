abstract: Globalization has increased international trade and caused an annual
  increase in the number of non-native insect pest species found in quarantine
  sites in Korea. Since over 80% of Korean farms use greenhouses with internal
  conditions conducive to growing crops and hospitable to exotic pests,
  efficient pest control is crucial. This study evaluated the efficacy of ethyl
  formate (EF) against three major exotic insect pests (Aphis gossypii,
  Frankliniella occidentalis, and Tetranychus urticae) and beneficial organisms
  (earthworms, honeybees, and silkworms) via EF fumigation experiments at two
  concentrations. The lethal concentration–time (LCt)99 values of A. gossypii,
  F. occidentalis, and T. urticae were 8.96, 14.00, and 19.07 g h/m3,
  respectively. Four hours of fumigation of EF at 15 g/m3 left no residue on the
  crops or soil after a maximum of 3 h. The beneficial organisms exhibited
  higher tolerance levels than A. gossypii with regard to LCt99 value, but the
  higher EF treatment dosage needed to control F. occidentalis and T. urticae
  could be highly lethal to honeybees. The lower EF dose (4 g/m3) effectively
  controlled A. gossypii, but 15 g/m3 was needed for F. occidentalis and T.
  urticae. Phytotoxicity varied in severity with EF concentration. These
  insights can help in developing a refined disinfestation strategy for
  greenhouses.
