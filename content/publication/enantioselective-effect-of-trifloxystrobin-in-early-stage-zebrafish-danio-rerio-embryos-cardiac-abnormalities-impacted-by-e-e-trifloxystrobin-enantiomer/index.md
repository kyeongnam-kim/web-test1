abstract: Trifloxystrobin (TFS) is one of the extensively used strobilurin
  fungicides, which is composed of four enantiomers and its active form is
  E,E-TFS. In this study, we assess the acute toxicity of four enantiomers,
  E,E−, E,Z-, Z,E−, and Z,Z-TFS in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Among the
  four enantiomers, only E,E-TFS was found to be acutely toxic, with an
  estimated LC50 value of 0.68 mg/L. Treatment with E,E-TFS resulted in various
  phenotypic changes in the embryos, including pericardial and yolk-sac edema,
  spine curvature, and blood pooling. And it shortened the whole body length in
  the treated embryos by increasing the total intersegmental vessel numbers
  using a Tg(fli1a:EGFP) zebrafish line. Further study using Tg(cmlc2:EGFP)
  zebrafish line revealed that E,E-TFS treatment was associated with cardiac
  malformations, a failure of heart function, and a lowered heartbeat rate at
  the concentration of 0.25 mg/L. Also, the differential gene expression
  analysis identified significant down-regulation of vmhc and cacna1c genes
  encoding ventricular myosin heavy chain and calcium voltage-gated channel
  subunit alpha 1C, which are crucial for heart development. These results
  suggest the need for regular monitoring of E,E-TFS enantiomers after field
  application and further research into their potential chronic effects on
  environmental organisms.

  *Highlights*

  • E,E-Trifloxystrobin (E,E-TFS) showed stronger acute toxicity to zebrafish embryos.

  • Among four enantiomers, only E,E-TFS exhibited LC50 value of 0.68 mg/L.

  • E,E-TFS caused morphological changes including pericardial and yolk-sac edemas.

  • E,E-TFS induced abnormal cardiac formation with the failure of heart function.
