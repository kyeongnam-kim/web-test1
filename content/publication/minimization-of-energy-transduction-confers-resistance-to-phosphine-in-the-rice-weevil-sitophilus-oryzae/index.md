abstract: Infestation of phosphine (PH3) resistant insects threatens global
  grain reserves. PH3 fumigation controls rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) but
  not highly resistant insect pests. Here, we investigated naturally occurring
  strains of S. oryzae that were moderately resistant (MR), strongly resistant
  (SR), or susceptible (wild-type; WT) to PH3 using global proteome analysis and
  mitochondrial DNA sequencing. Both PH3 resistant (PH3-R) strains exhibited
  higher susceptibility to ethyl formate-mediated inhibition of cytochrome c
  oxidase than the WT strain, whereas the disinfectant PH3 concentration time of
  the SR strain was much longer than that of the MR strain. Unlike the MR
  strain, which showed altered expression levels of genes encoding metabolic
  enzymes involved in catabolic pathways that minimize metabolic burden, the SR
  strain showed changes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Our results
  suggest that the acquisition of strong PH3 resistance necessitates the
  avoidance of oxidative phosphorylation through the accumulation of a few
  non-synonymous mutations in mitochondrial genes encoding complex I subunits as
  well as nuclear genes encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, concomitant
  with metabolic reprogramming, a recognized hallmark of cancer metabolism.
  Taken together, our data suggest that reprogrammed metabolism represents a
  survival strategy of SR insect pests for the compensation of minimized energy
  transduction under anoxic conditions. Therefore, understanding the resistance
  mechanism of PH3-R strains will support the development of new strategies to
  control insect pests.
