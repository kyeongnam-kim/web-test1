abstract: Pyrethroid and organochlorine insecticides are enormously used to
  control agricultural and indoor insect pests. The metabolites of pyrethroid
  and endosulfan were used to evaluate environmental toxicities using a
  representative animal model, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos in this study.
  The LC50 values in 3-phenoxy benzoic acid (3-PBA) and endosulfan sulfate (ES)
  were 1461 μg/L and 1459 μg/L, respectively. At the concentration of 2000 μg/L,
  spine curvature was observed in the ES-treated embryos. ES showed seizure-like
  events with an EC50 value of 354 μg/L. At the concentration of 1000 μg/L, the
  pericardial edema was observed in 3-PBA-treated embryos. The inhibition of
  heart development and the reduction of beating rates were observed in
  Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) embryos after the exposure to 3-PBA. Down-regulation of the
  vmhc gene coding ventricular myosin during heart development was significantly
  found in 3-PBA-treated embryos at 48 hpf, but recovered afterward. It
  indicates that ventricular malformation occurred at the initial stage of 3-PBA
  exposure. Considered together, both 3-PBA and ES need public concerns with
  periodic monitoring of these metabolites in households and agricultural areas
  to prevent humans and environmental organisms from their unexpected attacks.

  Highlights

  • 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) and endosulfan sulfate (ES) showed LC50 value of 1461 and 1459 µg/L, respectively.


  • 3-PBA caused pericardial edema in zebrafish embryos at 1000 and 2000 µg/L concentrations and hatching rates decreased.


  • Heart malformation in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) after 3-PBA treatment was occurred, and the heart beat rate dramatically decreased.


  • Seizure after ES exposure in zebrafish larvae were observed and EC50 value was reached to about 350 µg/L level.
