abstract: The effects of climate change and shifting consumer preferences for
  tropical/subtropical mango fruits have accelerated their greenhouse
  cultivation in South Korea, which has consequently exacerbated the risk of
  unexpected or exotic insect pest outbreaks. This study used the pest risk
  analysis (PRA) of greenhouse-cultivated mangoes provided by the Animal & Plant
  Quarantine Agency in Korea to evaluate the potential of ethyl formate (EF)
  fumigation as a new pest management strategy against the yellow tea thrips
  (*Scirtothrips dorsalis*), which is considered a surrogate pest in the thrips
  group according to the PRA. The efficacy and phytotoxicity of EF were
  evaluated in greenhouse-cultivated mango tree (Irwin variety) and post-harvest
  mango fruit scenarios. EF efficacy ranged from 6.25 to 6.89 g∙h/m³ for lethal
  concentration time (LCt)50 and from 17.10 to 18.18 g∙h/m³ for LCt99,
  indicating similar efficacy across both scenarios. Application of 10 g/m³ EF
  for 4 h at 23 °C could effectively control *S. dorsalis* (100% mortality)
  without causing phytotoxic damage to the greenhouse-cultivated mango trees,
  while post-harvest mango fruit fumigation with 15 g/m³ EF for 4 h at 10 °C
  showed potential for complete disinfestation of *S. dorsalis* without
  compromising fruit quality.
