abstract: Toxicological studies of O-ethyl-O-(4-nitrophenyl)
  phenylphosphonothioate (EPN) to aquatic vertebrates have been reported, but no
  reports on toxic mechanism was reported. As zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) embryos
  were exposed to EPN, no changes in their survival and hatching rates were
  observed until 96 h post fertilization (hpf), even at the highest treated
  concentration of 500 μg/L. In both 250 μg/L and 500 μg/L, edemas were observed
  in the heart and yolk sac, and a blood pool was also found. Acridine orange
  staining confirmed apoptotic phynotype, which was the strongest in embryos at
  48 hpf. No noticeable difference in the formation and the shape of blood
  vessels of Tg(fli1a:EGFP) was observed. However, the total body length and
  number of somite were decreased. Heart formation in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) were not
  properly proceeded, and the ventricle did not beat normally at 500 μg/L level.
  Cardiac development-related genes, myl7 and nppa, were significantly down- and
  up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner. The slowed heartbeat was
  confirmed using Tg(gata1:EGFP), showing stagnant blood flow and seizure-like
  events were observed. Altogether, EPN can be the cause for the abnormal heart
  development accompanied by blood stagnation in embryos, interfering normal
  development with their inner circulatory system.

  Highlights

  • EPN showed no changes in survival and hatching rates of zebrafish embryos.

  • In 250 ppb and 500 ppb levels, edemas were observed in heart and yolk sac.

  • Abnormal heart formation in Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) was clearly observed at 500 ppb level.

  • The slowed heartbeat confirmed using Tg(gata1:EGFP), showing stagnant blood flow.

  • Seizure-like events were determined using EEG system in EPN-treated larvae.
