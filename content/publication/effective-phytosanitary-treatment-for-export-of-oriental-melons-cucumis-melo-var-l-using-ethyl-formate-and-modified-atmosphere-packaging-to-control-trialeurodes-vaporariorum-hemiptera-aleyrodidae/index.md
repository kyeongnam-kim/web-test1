abstract: Understanding the phytotoxic mechanism of methyl bromide (MB), an
  essential fumigant during the quarantine and pre-shipment process, is urgently
  needed to ensure its proper use and reduce international economic losses. In a
  previous study, two main MB-induced toxic mechanisms such as reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and auxin distribution were selected by analyzing transcriptomic
  analysis. In the study, a 3-week-old A. thaliana was supplied with 1 mM ROS
  scavengers [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or L-glutathione (GSH)] and 1 Î¼M
  indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) three times every 12 h, and visual and gene
  expression assessments were performed to evaluate the reduction in
  phytotoxicity by supplements. Phytotoxic effects on the MB-4h exposed group
  were decreased with GSH application compared to the other single supplements
  and a combination of supplements at 7 days post fumigation. Among these
  supplements, GSH at a concentration of 1, 2, and 5 mM was suppled to A.
  thaliana with MB-fumigation. During a long-term observation of 2 weeks after
  the fumigation, 5 mM GSH application was the most effective in minimizing
  MB-induced phytotoxic effects with up-regulation of HSP70 expression and
  increase in main stem length. These results indicated that ROS was a main key
  factor of MB-induced phytotoxicity and that GSH can be used as a supplement to
  reduce the phytotoxicity of MB.
