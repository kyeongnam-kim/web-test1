abstract: "Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), commonly known as
  greenhouse whitefly, is one of the main insect pests of Oriental melon
  (Cucumis melo var L.) in South Korea. T. vaporariorum is of concern as a
  quarantine pest for the exportation of C. melo in Southeast Asian countries.
  Due to future restrictions on the use of methyl bromide (MB) during
  quarantine, ethyl formate (EF) represents a potential alternative. In this
  study, we evaluated EF for its efficacy (probit-9 values) in enabling the
  export of Oriental melons. The probit-9 value of EF for controlling T.
  vaporariorum was 3.02 g·h/m3 after 2 h of fumigation. We also assessed the
  phytotoxicity of EF on melons when using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP)
  under low-temperature conditions, which is required for export and trade, to
  extend shelf-life. In scaled-up trials, we found that 8 g/m3 EF for 2 h at 5°C
  to be suitable as a new phytosanitary treatment against greenhouse whitefly
  for exported Oriental melons when using MAP. No phytotoxic damage was found 28
  d after fumigation at 5°C in terms of five quality parameters (firmness, sugar
  content, mass loss, color change, and external damage)."
