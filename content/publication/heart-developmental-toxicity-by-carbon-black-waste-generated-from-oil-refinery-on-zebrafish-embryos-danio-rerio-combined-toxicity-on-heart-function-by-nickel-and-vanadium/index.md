abstract: This study assessed the developmental toxicities of water-soluble
  carbon black wastes (CBW) extract (1:5, w/v) in zebrafish embryos (Danio
  rerio). Acute embryonic toxicity was performed following OECD guideline 236.
  Analysis using ICP-OES revealed that nickel (Ni) and vanadium (V) were
  predominant in CBW. Embryos exposed to CBW exhibited developmental delay,
  along with pericardial and yolk sac edemas. Malformed heart chambers were
  found in the CBW-exposed embryos and heart rates were significantly reduced
  since 48 h post fertilization (hpf). After RT-qPCR analysis, two cardiac
  forming-related genes, amhc and nppa responsible for atrial cardiac myofibril
  assembly and cardiac muscle cell proliferation, were up-regulated after 96
  hpf. The increased mortality and delayed yolk-sac development appeared related
  to CBW-induced decrease in pH to about 5.5. Individual treatments of Ni and V
  did not cause identical toxic effects as CBW showed. At 100 ppm, V had a pH of
  approximately 5.5, causing developmental delay and pericardial edema in
  zebrafish embryos. At the same pH, combined Ni and V induced morphological
  anomalies and reduced heart rates similar to CBW-exposed embryos.
  Conclusively, this study demonstrates that environmental runoff is a serious
  concern, and thus, CBW incineration bottom ash should be treated carefully
  before disposal in landfills.
