abstract: Phosphine (PH3) is an ideal fumigant alternative on methyl bromide
  (MB) as MB has been classified as an ozone-depleting substance. However,
  several challenges limit its efficient use in crop production, including the
  emergence of PH3-resistant insect pests and the incidence of phytotoxic
  effects on nursery plants. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the
  mechanism underlying PH3 phytotoxicity in plants using transcriptomic
  techniques. Fumigation with 2 g/m3 PH3 induced phytotoxic effects in A.
  thaliana, as evidenced by a decrease in growth and vegetation indices compared
  to the control group. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PH3 fumigation
  phytotoxicity responses in A. thaliana involve genes related to hypoxia stress
  and energy metabolism. Additionally, pretreatment with ethylene induced
  pre-adaptation to hypoxia under light conditions during fumigation effectively
  suppressed the phytotoxic effects of PH3 in A. thaliana by increasing the
  expression of hypoxia-adaptive genes. Moreover, the phytotoxicity of PH3 was
  also confirmed in pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata Duch.), and was dependent on
  light. Overall, our findings showed that fumigation under light conditions and
  ethylene pretreatment could be used to minimize PH3-induced phytotoxic effects
  in plants.

  *Highlights*

  • Transcriptomic analysis revealed the toxic mechanism of PH3 using A. thaliana.

  • The phytotoxicity of PH3 was correlated with hypoxia stress and energy metabolism.

  • As per the light conditions, PH3 showed an opposite phytotoxic pattern.

  • PH3 had the property of inducing hypoxia adaptive genes like ethylene.
