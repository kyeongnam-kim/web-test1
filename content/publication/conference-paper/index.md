abstract: "Endosulfan sulfate is a major oxidative metabolite of the chlorinated
  insecticide endosulfan. In this study, a targeted metabolomics approach was
  used to investigate the toxic mechanisms of endosulfan sulfate in adult
  zebrafish using the multiple reaction monitoring mode of a GC-MS/MS. The LC50
  of endosulfan sulfate in adult zebrafish was determined and then zebrafish
  were exposed to endosulfan sulfate at one-tenth the LC50 (0.1LC50) or the LC50
  for 24 and 48â€¯h. After exposure, the fish were extracted, derivatized and
  analyzed by GC-MS/MS for 379 metabolites to identify 170 metabolites. Three
  experimental groups (control, 0.1LC50 and LC50) were clearly separated in
  PLS-DA score plots. Based on the VIP, ANOVA, and fold change results, 40
  metabolites were selected as biomarkers. Metabolic pathways associated with
  those metabolites were identified using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 as follows:
  aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, valine/leucine/isoleucine biosynthesis, citrate
  cycle, glycerolipid metabolism, and arginine/proline metabolism. Gene
  expression studies confirmed the activation of citrate cycle and glycerolipids
  metabolism. MDA levels of the exposed group significantly increased in
  oxidative toxicity assay tests. Such significant perturbations of important
  metabolites within key biochemical pathways must result in biologically
  hazardous effects in zebrafish."
