abstract: Piperaceae plants consist of about 3600 species, of which about 2000
  are Piper plants. Their habitat is distributed across pantropical regions. The
  representative plant is Piper nigrum, known as black pepper. These plants have
  been widely used in folk medicine in Korean traditional medicine. This review
  collected papers identifying and separating the amides obtained from these
  Piper plants, with a focus on Piper amides potential to control the production
  and growth of fungal strains that cause plant disease and their insecticidal
  properties against agricultural pests. Piper amide benefits include
  antiaflatoxigenic activities, antiparasitic activities, anticancer properties,
  antiplatelet activities, and anti-inflammatory activities, among other
  therapeutic properties for the treatment of human diseases. In addition, this
  review paper provides a total synthesis study on the mass production of Piper
  amides and their derivatives, with a formulation study for industrial use.
  This review paper is designed to help inform future studies on Piper amide
  applications.
