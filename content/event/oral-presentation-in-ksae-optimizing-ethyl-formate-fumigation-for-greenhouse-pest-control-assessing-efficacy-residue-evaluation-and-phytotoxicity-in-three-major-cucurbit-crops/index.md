abstract: This study aims to evaluate the optimized ethyl formate (EF)
  fumigation method for controlling two major insect pests, Myzus persicae and
  Trips palmi, in greenhouse-grown cucurbit crops including watermelon,
  zucchini, and melon. We investigated (1) EF residue levels and their potential
  environmental impact using headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
  (HS-GC-MS), (2) phytotoxicity in three crops at different developmental stages
  under both laboratory and field conditions, and (3) strategies to mitigate
  phytotoxicity, thus broadening the range of target pests at more higher
  concentration. Our findings indicate that optimized EF fumigation can
  effectively control greenhouse pests while enhancing environmental
  sustainability and minimizing phytotoxic effects on cucurbit crops. This
  research provides valuable insights into the development of environmentally
  responsible pest control strategies for greenhouse cultivation.
